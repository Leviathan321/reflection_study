# NSGAII-DT Replication Results

This repository holds the results of the NSGAII-DT replication study from the paper "Reflections on Surrogate-Assisted Search-Based Testing: A Taxonomy and Two Replication Studies based on Industrial ADAS and Simulink Models"

## Algorithm

The implementation of NSGAII-DT is based on pymoo and an excerpt of the implementation is provided [here](algorithm/nsga2_dt_sim.py).

## Combined Results

The *Hypervolume* analysis results are available here: [HV](/hv/) 

The *Spread* analysis results are available here: [Spread](/sp/) 

The *General Distance* analysis results are available here: [GD](/gd/) 

## Results Single Runs

The results of each single run of NSGAII are available here: [Single Runs NSGAII](NSGA-II/)

The results of each single run of NSGAII-DT are available here: [Single Runs NSGAII-DT](NSGA-II-DT/)
